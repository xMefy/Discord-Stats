Ever wondered what Data discord collects? Or did you ever want to view what's inside of a discord package? Discord Stats is a customisable tool that allows you to view your data in a fancy way. You could also use our exporting feature to share your selected data with your friends.

This service **does not** use any third party services and does not collect any data.
